## TL;DR

- Designed and analyzed a controlled A/B experiment on early-game progression gating
- Variant (Gate at Level 40) caused \~5% D7 retention drop with no meaningful revenue upside
- Final decision: ❌ Not rolled out to production

## 2. Background & Motivation

### Problem Statement (Before Optimization)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[New User Enters Game]
B[Early Progression]
C[First Progression Gate]
D[User Friction]
E[Drop in Retention]

A --> B --> C --> D --> E
```

**Progression gates** are commonly used to control pacing and monetization. However, poorly placed gates can introduce excessive friction and harm retention.

---

## 3. Experiment Design

### Hypothesis

> Moving the **first progression gate** earlier (Gate 40) will increase early engagement and monetization **without harming retention**.

### Variants

| Group   | Description             |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| Control | Original gate placement |
| Variant | Gate moved to level 40  |

## 5. Key Metrics

| Metric          | Why It Matters           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| D1 Retention    | Early engagement quality |
| D7 Retention    | Long-term value signal   |
| Conversion Rate | Monetization impact      |

## 6. Results Summary

### 6.1 Retention Curves (Synthetic Data for Illustration)

> The following figures represent **synthetic but realistic data**, used to demonstrate analytical reasoning and communication.

**Figure 1. D1–D7 Retention Curve (Control vs Variant)**

| Day | Control | Gate 40 |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| D1  | 38%     | 37%     |
| D2  | 30%     | 28%     |
| D3  | 26%     | 23%     |
| D5  | 21%     | 18%     |
| D7  | 18%     | **13%** |

**Interpretation**:

- Retention gap widens over time
- Indicates compounding early-game friction

### 6.2 Aggregated Metric Comparison

**Figure 2. Key Metric Summary (Synthetic)**

| Metric          | Control | Gate 40 | Relative Change |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| D1 Retention    | 38%     | 37%     | -2.6%           |
| D7 Retention    | 18%     | 13%     | **-27.8%**      |
| Conversion Rate | 4.2%    | 4.3%    | +2.4%           |
| ARPU            | \$1.00  | \$1.02  | +2%             |

> Small monetization lift does **not compensate** for retention loss.

\---|---|---|---| | D1 Retention | Baseline | Slight ↓ | - | | D7 Retention | Baseline | **\~5% ↓** | ❌ | | Conversion Rate | Baseline | Marginal ↑ | Insignificant |

### 6.3 Statistical Interpretation (Analyst View)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Observed Retention Drop]
B[Check Sample Size & Variance]
C[Statistical Significance]
D[Effect Size Meaningful]
E[Negative Product Impact]

A --> B --> C --> D --> E
```

- Retention decline is **directionally consistent across cohorts**
- Effect size at D7 is **material at scale**
- Monetization uplift does **not offset retention loss**

\---|---|---|---| | D1 Retention | Baseline | Slight ↓ | - | | D7 Retention | Baseline | **\~5% ↓** | ❌ |

### Interpretation

```mermaid

A[Earlier Gate]
B[Higher Friction]
C[Lower User Motivation]
D[Retention Drop]

## 7. Business Impact

| Area                | Impact      |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| User Retention      | ❌ Negative  |
| Revenue at Scale    | ❌ High Risk |
| Design Assumptions  | Challenged  |
| Decision Confidence | ✅ High      |

---

## 8. Final Recommendation

```mermaid
flowchart TB
A[Analyze Results]
B{Retention Impact Acceptable?}
C[Ship Variant]
D[Reject Variant]

A --> B
B -- Yes --> C
B -- No --> D
```

### Decision

❌ **Do NOT roll out Gate 40 configuration**

From a long-term value perspective, the retention loss outweighs short-term monetization signals.

---

## 9. Key Takeaways (Data Scientist / Product Analyst Lens)

- **Early-game friction is a dominant driver of long-term retention**
- Optimizing monetization mechanics without cohort-level retention analysis is risky
- A/B testing is as much about **falsifying assumptions** as it is about finding wins
- Small percentage changes (≈5% D7) translate to **large absolute impact** at scale

---

## 10. What This Project Demonstrates (GitHub-Oriented)

- End-to-end experiment ownership: design → analysis → decision
- Retention-focused evaluation beyond surface-level metric lifts
- Ability to say **no** to product changes backed by data
- Clear communication of trade-offs to product stakeholders

## 11. Possible Next Experiments

```mermaid

A[Rejected Gate 40]
B[Test Later Gate]
C[Adaptive / Soft Gate]
D[Cohort-based Personalization]

A --> B --> C --> D
```

- Explore later or softer progression constraints
- Segment by skill, tenure, or early engagement
- Optimize monetization **without degrading retention**
